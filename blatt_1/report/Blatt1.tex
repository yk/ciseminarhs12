\section{Exercise 2}
\subsection{Smoothing}

In this exercise we are presented with two images of the same scene. Artificial noise has been added to both images, in image one, it looks like it was white noise, whereas in image 2 it looks more like a salt-and-pepper kind of noise. Smoothing or blurring is a frequently used technique to reduce noise in an image. There are different kind of filters. We were asked to use and compare three: Gaussian Blur, Median Blur and normal Blur.
\paragraph{Blur}
The blur filter or normalized box filter is the most simple linear filter. Each output pixel is just the mean of all $n*n$ pixel surrounding it.
\paragraph{Gaussian Blur}
Another frequently used linear filter. The value of each output pixel is now determined by the weighted mean of its neighbours. The weights are determined by a bivariate gaussian distribution.
\paragraph{Median Blur}
The median blur is a non linear filter, since the computation of the median is a non-linear operation. The value of an output pixel is determined by the median of its surrounding neigbours.

\subsection{Applying the filters}
The results of applying the normalized box filter can be seen in \ref{fig:blur}. I used the function \textit{blur} of the OpenCV API to apply blur filters of different kernel size. Only the images for the 3x3 and the 9x9 kernels are shown. Similarly, the application of the gaussian filter can be seen in \ref{fig:gblur}, and the results of the median filters is shown in \ref{fig:mblur}.

\subsection{The Laplacian}
Edge detection is a very important and frequently encountered problem in image processing. Detecting edges in visual scenes seems to be a very trivial task for us. But what actually "makes" an edge? If we look at the pixel intensity of an image, edges are characterized by a very fast change of intensity over space. If we look at the one dimensional case and model pixel intensity by $I(x)$, finding edges corresponds to finding maximas in $\dot{I}(x)$ or finding $x$ such that $\ddot{I}(x) = 0$. In two dimensional images, this corresponds to computing the laplacian
There are several ways of detecting edges in images,
